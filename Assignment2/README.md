#Introduction
This is the README for the submission of Second Pair Assignment by Diego and Isabelle.This assignment is a research proposal for our Collaborative Research Project. All the information related to this second assignment is located in the folder Assignment 2 inside of the GitHub repository called **IsabelleandDiegosFinalResearchProject**. 

This Second Pair Assignment should be used as an opportunity to layout our collaborative research paper question, justify why it is interesting, provide a basic literature review (properly cited using BibTeX), and identify data sources/methodologies that we can access to help answer our question.The deadline is 25 March, we are allowed to write a maximum of 2,000 words and it will account for the 10% of our final grade. 

#Research proposal
Our research proposal provides a comprehensive literature review of the concept of democracy, a clearly defined research question, a list of variables that we are intending to use as well as a reflection on methodological issues.
Our research question asks what are the effects of ethnic fractionalization on political rights. In this sense, our main hypothesis is that high ethnic fractionalization will have a significant negative impact on the preservation of political rights, when the countryÂ´s given quality of democracy is low.
