Merkel's Concept of Embedded & Defective Democracies
========================================================
Internal and external embeddedness 

- External: spheres of enabling conditions that protect from         destabilization.

- Internal: independence and interdependence of five "partial regimes". We focus on political rights of participation - freedom of speech and opinion + freedom of association, demonstration, and petition. 


Research Question and Variables

-Hypothesis: the more ethnically fractionalized a country is, the higher its negative impact on political rights if income inequality is high. 

-DV - pressfreedom; IV - ethnicfrac + gini + ethnicfrac*gini + GDPpercapita + langfrac + judindep
